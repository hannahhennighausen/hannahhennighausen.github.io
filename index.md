I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral College Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). My research focuses broadly on applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in how humans prepare for- and respond to infrequent environmental events like floods and wildfires. Thanks for stopping by!

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** with Jordan Suter <br />
_R&R @ Land Economics_

  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.
