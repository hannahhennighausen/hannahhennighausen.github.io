I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Economics](https://business.uaa.alaska.edu/departments/economics-public-policy/) at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  I completed my PhD in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/), where I was also a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral School Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). I hold a master's degree in agricultural and resource economics from UC Davis and a bachelor's degree in economics from American University.

The central theme of my research is investigating how individuals adapt to environmental risk, deriving insights from quasi-experimental methods applied to administrative and geospatial datasets.

My current work is motivated by increasing pressures from climate change complicated by socio-economic factors. In examining behavioral responses to risk, I aim to inform policymakers about the distribution of future climate change costs and assist them in their decision-making about local, risk-reducing investments.

In my free time you'll find me in the mountains or on the river.

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** (2020) with Jordan Suter <br />
Published @ Land Economics <br />

The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.

**CITES and the Zoonotic Disease Content in International Wildlife Trade** (2020) with Stefan Borsky, Andrea Leiter and Keith Williges <br />

International  trade  in  wildlife  is  one  contributing  factor  to  zoonotic  disease  risk.   Using  descriptive statistics, this paper shows that in the last decades, the volume and pattern of internationally traded wildlife has changed considerably and, with it, the zoonotic pathogens that are traded.  In an econometric analysis, we give evidence that an international environmental trade agreement could be used to limit the spread of zoonotic pathogens and disease.  More specifically, combining zoonotic disease data with wildlife trade data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife and Fauna (CITES), we show that making trade requirements more stringent leads to a decrease in the number of animals traded and, incidentally, also the number of zoonotic diseases that are traded.  Our results contribute to the discussion of policy measures that manage the spread of zoonotic diseases.

# Working Papers

**Disaster-driven adaptation in the insurance market: the case of Hurricane Sandy** <br />
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
Climate change and urbanization are escalating flood risk around the globe. Studying the factors that drive people to adapt to their changing risks aids policy makers in predicting future flooding costs and policy needs. This paper investigates the role of experienced risk in adaptation decisions. I exploit spatial variation in flooding to estimate the causal effect of Hurricane Sandy on people's decisions to insure against future flood damages. Hurricane Sandy’s flooding boundaries had a large and long-lived impact. Since the storm, flood insurance demand in flooded areas has continuously increased relative to nearby areas that were not flooded. The estimated insurance response was driven by the purchase and retention of relatively cheaper policies located in the most flood-damaged areas, implying that cost was a critical factor in people's adaptation decisions. Simulated flooding extents of six other recent events give evidence that Hurricane Sandy's adaptation response was the exception and not the rule.

**Public flood risk mitigation and the homeowner’s insurance demand response** with Stefan Borsky <br /> _under review_ <br />
[Manuscript](https://hannahhennighausen.github.io/Papers/BorskyHennighausen_CRS.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
This paper investigates the influence of public risk mitigating activities on individuals’ decisions to privately mitigate their disaster risks. We exploit heterogeneity in measures under the Community Rating System in the U.S. to empirically demonstrate that government investment in flood risk communication activities crowd-in private flood insurance demand while activities that lower the flood hazard residents face crowd-out private flood insurance demand. We also give evidence that flood insurance abides by the law of demand: as com- munities receive price discounts on their insurance policies, demand increases. Our results imply that governments can amplify the price effect by investing in additional risk communication activities, or dilute it by investing in hazard mitigation. This paper contributes to the discussion of the efficacy of disaster risk mitigation strategies and who ultimately bears the costs of natural disasters.
