I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral College Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). My research focuses broadly on applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in how humans prepare for- and respond to infrequent environmental events like floods and wildfires. Thanks for stopping by!
