I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral College Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). My research focuses broadly on applied microeconomics. I study how individuals and institutions prepare for- and respond to infrequent environmental events, deriving insights from quasi-experimental methods.

In my free time I like skiing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting.

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** with Jordan Suter <br />

  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.

**Homebuyer income in the wake of Hurricane Sandy** <br />
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
Linking individual financial outcomes with flood events provides insight into how populations in affected areas respond to natural disaster events. This paper uses a flexible event study design to estimate the causal effect of Hurricane Sandy’s flooding on home loan borrowers’ (homebuyers’) incomes. Annual incomes are shown to have decreased by 2.5-3% in the most damaged areas, with the effect persisting until the end of the study period. Preliminary evidence suggests that a property devaluation effect in the flooded areas attracted lower income homebuyers, in turn potentially reducing the flood risky areas’ capacity to cope with future floods.
