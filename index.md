I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Graz and a member of the interdisciplinary Doctoral College Climate Change at the Wegener Center. My research focuses broadly on applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in how humans prepare for- and respond to infrequent environmental events like floods and wildfires. Thanks for stopping by!
