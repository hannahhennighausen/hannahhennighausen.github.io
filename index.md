I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral School Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). I have a master's degree in agricultural and resource economics from UC Davis and a bachelor's degree in economics from American University.

The central theme of my research is investigating how individuals adapt to environmental risk, deriving insights from quasi-experimental methods applied to administrative and geospatial datasets.

My current work is motivated by increasing pressures from climate change complicated by socio-economic factors. In examining behavioral responses to risk, I aim to inform policymakers about the distribution of future climate change costs and assist them in their decision-making about local, risk-reducing investments.

In my free time you'll find me in the mountains or on the river.

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** with Jordan Suter <br />

The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.

# Working Papers

**Disaster-driven adaptation in the insurance market: the case of Hurricane Sandy** <br />
[Manuscript](https://hannahhennighausen.github.io/Papers/SandyInsurance.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
Climate change and urbanization are escalating flood risk around the globe. Studying the factors that drive people to adapt to their changing risks aids policy makers in predicting future flooding costs and policy needs. This paper investigates the role of experienced risk in adaptation decisions. I exploit spatial variation in flooding to estimate the causal effect of Hurricane Sandy on people's decisions to insure against future flood damages. Hurricane Sandy’s flooding boundaries had a large and long-lived impact. Since the storm, flood insurance demand in flooded areas has continuously increased relative to nearby areas that were not flooded. The estimated insurance response was driven by the purchase and retention of relatively cheaper policies located in the most flood-damaged areas, implying that cost was a critical factor in people's adaptation decisions. Simulated flooding extents of six other recent events give evidence that Hurricane Sandy's adaptation response was the exception and not the rule.

**Public risk communication and private adaptation: evidence from the Community Rating System** with Stefan Borsky <br />
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
This paper evaluates the relationship between community flood risk mitigation efforts and individual’s decisions to private mitigate flood risk through insurance purchases. Using activity data from the Community Rating System, we estimated a positive, statistically significant relationship between fulfillment of public risk communication activities and insurance purchases. We also estimated a negative, statistically significant relationship between fulfillment of public hazard mitigation activities and insurance purchases. Our findings suggest private flood risk adaptation in response to hazard information but that public hazard mitigation efforts may crowd out private adaptative actions.
