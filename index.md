I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral School Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). I have a master's degree in agricultural and resource economics from UC Davis and a bachelor's degree in economics from American University.

The central theme of my research is investigating how individuals adapt to environmental risk, deriving insights from quasi-experimental methods applied to administrative and geospatial datasets.

My current work is motivated by increasing pressures from climate change complicated by socio-economic factors. In examining behavioral responses to risk, I aim to inform policymakers about the distribution of future climate change costs and assist them in their decision-making about local, risk-reducing investments.

In my free time you'll find me in the mountains or on the river.

# Publications

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** with Jordan Suter <br />

  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.

# Working Papers

**Disaster-driven adaptation in the insurance market: the case of Hurricane Sandy** <br />
[Manuscript](https://hannahhennighausen.github.io/Papers/SandyInsurance.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  Climate change and urbanization are escalating flood risk around the globe. Understanding how people adapt to changes in their perceived flood risk helps predict future costs to flooding. Using spatial variation in flooding, I provide causal estimates of direct experience with Hurricane Sandy’s flooding on participation in the flood insurance market. Hurricane Sandy had a large impact on people’s insurance choices. Since the storm, the number of insurance policies-in-force in flooded areas has continuously increased relative to areas that were not flooded. Extensions to the main specification show that damage intensity, proximity to the flooding and having little previous knowledge about flood risk all contributed to the marked insurance growth. Simulated flooding extents of six other recent flood events give evidence that Hurricane Sandy’s insurance response was the exception and not the rule.
