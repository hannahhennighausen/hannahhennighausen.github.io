I am a PhD student in economics at the [University of Graz](https://volkswirtschaftslehre.uni-graz.at/en/) and a member of the interdisciplinary [Doctoral College Climate Change](https://dk-climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [Wegener Center](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/). My research focuses broadly on applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in how humans prepare for- and respond to infrequent environmental events like floods and wildfires. Thanks for stopping by!

**Flood risk perception in the housing market and the impact of a major flood event** with Jordan Suter <br />
_R&R @ Land Economics_

  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
The impact of flood events on flood risk perception has important implications for policy. Applying a novel dataset featuring the flooding extents from a severe event in Colorado, we disentangle inundated properties from "near-misses", defined as structures not directly flooded but located in the 100- year floodplain. Using a triple-difference hedonic framework, we show that inundated properties in the floodplain underwent a decrease in price after the flood, while "near-misses" saw a relative price increase. We speculate that inundated properties are perceived as being riskier and "near-misses" relatively less risky, suggesting the possible influence of the availability heuristic or Bayesian learning.

**Weathering the shock: credit-worthiness and mortgage delinquency in the wake of flood events** <br />
<details>
  <summary>[Expand/Hide Abstract]</summary>
  
Linking individual financial outcomes with flood events provides insights into the extent to which affected individuals are affected by natural disaster events as well as the effectiveness of consumption- smoothing government initiatives like the National Flood Insurance Program. This paper uses a non- parametric event study design to estimate the causal effect of 35 flood events on “credit-worthiness”, short- and long-term mortgage delinquency rates in the United States. For this purpose, I construct a comprehensive 10-year panel dataset by linking information on Presidential Disaster Declaration flood events to Equifax/Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) individual financial outcome data, aggregated to the county-level for each year-quarter time step. Preliminary results show that “credit-worthiness” improves after a flood event, likely because the cash shock from flood insurance payments is being used to reduce debt levels. No change is observed for mortgage delinquency rates after a flood event, suggesting that debt reduction is coming from another loan source. Further research, to be completed in the coming months, will focus on the welfare implications of using insurance payouts to reduce debt levels (possibly as a substitute to disaster repairs) as well as pinpointing the drivers behind the change in “credit-worthiness”.
